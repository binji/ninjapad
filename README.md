# NinjaPad v1.3.0
NinjaPad is a retro emulation graphical interface for both desktop and mobile.  
Originally meant for the NES emulation, NinjaPad is designed in a developer
friendly way, allowing for anyone to expand its capabilities.

## Try it
https://ninjadynamics.github.io/ninjapad/  
On desktop, use the ESC key to bring up the menu.  
Don't forget to try it on your phone as well! ;)  

## Quickstart
Add the folder '**ninjapad**' to your project root  
Configure NinjaPad by editing the file '**ninjapad/config/settings.js**'  
Use the '**index.html**' example file for reference on how to integrate NinjaPad with your existing project  
If you're using NinjaPad to showcase your indie game, I'd recommend you setting '**SINGLE_ROM = true**'
in the config file.  

## Dependencies
- jQuery  
- Emulators

## Interfaces
The file '**ninjapad/interface.js**' allows you to create new interfaces for different emulators.  
Use the existing **JSNES** or **BinjNES* interface as a template to create your own.
